      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
      <p>
        PAWS of Austin is a nonprofit organization focused on rescuing and rehoming
        large-breed dogs. Their existing website was outdated and disorganized,
        making it difficult for users to adopt, volunteer, or donate.
        My redesign focused on improving clarity, emotional connection,
        and overall usability.

      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Navigation was unclear and important pages were difficult to find</li>
        <li>No strong calls-to-action for adoption, volunteering, or donations</li>
        <li>Outdated visual design that did not inspire trust or engagement</li>
        <li>Not optimized for mobile users</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Solution</h3>
      <p>
        I redesigned the site structure and interface to create a clear,
        emotionally engaging experience. The new design prioritizes
        adoptable dogs, streamlines navigation, and introduces clear,
        accessible calls-to-action for key user goals.
