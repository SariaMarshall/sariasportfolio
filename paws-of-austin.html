    <h1>PAWS of Austin – Animal Rescue Website Redesign</h1>
    <p>UX/UI Case Study</p>
  </header>

  <section class="case-container">
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      PAWS of Austin is a nonprofit animal rescue organization dedicated to helping 
      abandoned, injured, and displaced animals. The goal of this redesign was to 
      strengthen the organization’s online presence, improve adoptability visibility, 
      and create an easier, more welcoming experience for potential adopters, donors, 
      and volunteers.
    </p>

    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>UX/UI Designer</li>
      <li>Information Architecture</li>
      <li>Wireframing & Layout Design</li>
      <li>Visual Branding</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
      The original PAWS of Austin website was outdated, visually inconsistent, and hard 
      to navigate. Important content—such as available dogs, adoption information, and 
      donation options—was difficult to find. As a result, users experienced confusion 
      and the organization missed opportunities for support.
    </p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p>
      The redesigned experience introduces clear navigation, updated visual branding, 
      and improved accessibility. The new structure highlights adoptable pets, explains 
      the adoption process, and streamlines donations to increase support for the 
      organization’s mission.

    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <p>
      The updated design established a warm and trustworthy feel, making it easier 
      for users to connect emotionally with the dogs and the mission. The improved 
      layout and simplified information flow create a smoother experience for 
      adopters and supporters.
