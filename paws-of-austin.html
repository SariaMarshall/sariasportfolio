  <h3>Problem</h3>
  <p>
    Pet owners struggle to find trustworthy, available sitters without
    spending excessive time comparing profiles and managing communication
    across platforms.
  </p>

  <h3>Solution</h3>
  <p>
    I designed a streamlined booking flow that emphasizes sitter trust
    indicators, availability clarity, and simple communication tools.
  </p>

  <h3>Outcome</h3>
  <p>
    The concept delivers a more confident, efficient booking experience
    that prioritizes pet safety and user peace of mind.

  <h3>Project Overview</h3>
  <p>
    PAWS of Austin is a nonprofit focused on rescuing and rehoming large-breed dogs. 
    Their website was outdated, disorganized, and did not effectively guide users to adopt, 
    volunteer, or donate. My redesign focused on clarity, emotion, and improving the overall 
    user experience.
