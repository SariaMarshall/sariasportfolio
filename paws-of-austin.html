      Overview

PAWS of Austin is a nonprofit specializing in rescuing and rehoming large-breed dogs. Their existing site was outdated and overwhelming, making it difficult for visitors to adopt, foster, or donate.

Problem

The main issues:

Complicated navigation

Inconsistent visual hierarchy

Hard-to-find adoption info

Donation flow not emphasized

Overwhelming text density

The nonprofit needed a website that felt trustworthy and made it easier for the community to take action.

My Role

UX/UI Designer

Researcher

Visual design & layout

Process
1. Heuristic Evaluation

I identified several usability issues:

Poor contrast

Long paragraphs

Misaligned content blocks

Outdated color palette

Crowded information

2. User Needs

Nonprofit users want:

Quick access to adoptable dogs

Clear steps to get involved

Trust signals

Fast access to donate buttons

3. Redesign Direction

I focused on:

A modern, friendly color palette

High-quality dog photography

Clear funnels for "Adopt," "Foster," and "Donate"

A simpler IA (information architecture)

4. Layout Exploration

I created wireframes to improve:

Homepage storytelling

Dog listing grid

Donation flow hierarchy

Footer structure

Solution

The final design is clean, modern, and emotionally supportive. Key areas like adoptable dogs and donations are now front-and-center.

Outcome

Stronger visual hierarchy

Intuitive navigation

Faster access to key actions

A site that feels modern and trustworthy

This redesign helps PAWS of Austin better support dogs and connect with their community.
