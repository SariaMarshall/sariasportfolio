      Overview

Centered Mind Counseling is my mother’s trauma-focused therapy practice. The original site lacked warmth, clarity, and accessibility. As her first client project, I redesigned, coded, and published the entire website end-to-end with a focus on calm, trust, and emotional safety.

Problem

The existing site was:

Visually outdated

Inconsistent with her brand tone

Hard to navigate

Not mobile-friendly

Missing clear calls-to-action for new clients

For a therapy practice, the site should feel grounding, welcoming, and trustworthy — and the old design wasn’t creating that experience.

My Role

UX/UI Designer

Developer (HTML/CSS)

Brand direction

Content structure

Accessibility lead

Process
1. Research

I analyzed 12 therapist websites and identified common patterns:
• soft tones
• simple structure
• large photography
• clear service descriptions
• strong first-impression hero sections

I paired this with insights from my direct interviews with my mom about her ideal client and brand tone.

2. Visual Direction

I selected:

Green + beige to support emotional calm and grounding

A serif + sans-serif pairing to balance professionalism and warmth

Rounded shapes and large spacing to soften the UI

3. Wireframing

I created low-fidelity layouts focusing on:

Simple navigation

A clear “Let’s Talk” CTA

A safe, compassionate tone through spacing and imagery

4. Development

I fully coded the site using HTML + CSS:

Responsive design for all breakpoints

Strong contrast for readability

Fixed inconsistencies from the previous build

Solution

The final website is warm, cohesive, and easy to navigate. The homepage now tells her story clearly, highlights her specialties, and makes it easy for clients to contact her.

Outcome

A more professional online presence

Increased trust and emotional alignment

Significantly improved mobile experience

Clearer client pathways

Her practice now has a site that reflects her mission and personality — gentle, grounded, and safe.
