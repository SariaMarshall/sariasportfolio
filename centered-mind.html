  <h3>Project Overview</h3>
  <p>
    Centered Mind Counseling is my mother’s private practice specializing in trauma therapy. 
    Her old website lacked warmth, clarity, and modern structure. My goal was to create a 
    site that reflects her personality — kind, grounded, and compassionate — while making it 
    easy for potential clients to find information and reach out.

  <h3>Problem</h3>
  <p>
    The original website was outdated, text-heavy, and difficult to navigate. It lacked emotional warmth 
    and failed to communicate her story, her approach, or the safe environment she offers clients.

  <h3>Goals</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Design a modern, soft, approachable website.</li>
    <li>Improve clarity around offered services.</li>
    <li>Highlight trauma-informed care.</li>
    <li>Make the contact process simple and inviting.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Visual Direction</h3>
  <p>
    I created a color palette using greens and neutrals, combined with serif and sans-serif typography 
    to balance professionalism with warmth.

  <h3>Final Website</h3>
  <p>
    The final design is soft, comforting, and easy to navigate — a true reflection of her practice.
