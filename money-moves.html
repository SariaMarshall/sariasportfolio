      Overview

Money Moves is a financial literacy app that helps users build credit, learn money basics, and track financial growth. It is aimed at users who feel overwhelmed by budgeting and credit management.

Problem

Many young adults struggle with:

Understanding credit

Creating healthy budgeting habits

Knowing what impacts their score

Knowing where to start

Existing apps feel too complex or assume a high level of financial knowledge.

My Role

UX/UI Designer

Research

Wireframes

User flows

Process
1. Research

I analyzed credit education platforms and budgeting apps.
Most were overwhelming, number-heavy, or not beginner-friendly.

2. Persona Insights

The target user needs:

Simple explanations

Bite-sized learning

Clear progress tracking

A judgment-free tone

3. Information Architecture

I structured the app around three main pillars:

Learn — Modules teaching financial concepts

Build — Credit-building steps and reminders

Track — Credit score and budgeting overview

4. Low-Fidelity Wireframes

Features include:

Learning paths

Credit score simulation

Budget builder

Savings goals

Rewards for completing modules

Solution

Money Moves creates an accessible, friendly introduction to financial literacy. Instead of overwhelming dashboards, it guides users one step at a time.

Outcome

Simplified financial education

Clear pathways to better credit

Encouraging, non-judgmental UX tone

This project demonstrates my ability to handle educational UX and simplify complex topics
