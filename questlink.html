     Overview

QuestLink is a social networking app for tabletop RPG and board-game enthusiasts. It connects players, game masters, and event hosts in local communities.

This project reached the low-fidelity prototype stage.

Problem

TTRPG players struggle with:

Finding local groups

Coordinating game sessions

Matching playstyles

Keeping track of campaigns

Current platforms (Discord, Facebook groups, Meetup) are broad and not tailored to TTRPG needs.

My Role

UX Research

User flows

Low-fidelity wireframes

Interaction structure

Process
1. Research

I conducted pattern analysis across:

TTRPG forums

Meetup

Discord communities

Player surveys

Users consistently reported frustration around unreliable groups, scheduling, and mismatched playstyles.

2. User Goals

Players want to:

Find local groups quickly

See who is a GM, player, or host

Filter by playstyle, game type, and experience

Avoid flaky or unsafe situations

3. Wireframing

I mapped core flows:

Onboarding with preferences

Group discovery

Game hosting

Group chat & scheduling

Player profiles

4. Low-Fidelity Prototype

The prototype includes:

A card-based group discovery screen

A scheduling hub

Event creation for hosts

Clear tags for experience level and playstyle

Solution

QuestLink solves a real community problem by giving players one dedicated platform to connect, plan, and play.

Even at the low-fidelity stage, the concept has strong potential for high usability and community impact.
